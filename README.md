Welcome to "Super Student Bros: The Corona Years" - a browser-based game that is a hilarious parody on the life of a student in Techno Main Salt Lake. In this game, you'll take control of your favorite student character and navigate through the challenges of remote learning during the pandemic.

Instead of the usual Goombas, you'll be battling the dreaded Corona Virus Goombas that are out to get you. And instead of collecting coins, you'll be collecting those pesky worksheets that your teachers keep assigning.

But fear not, dear student, for there are hidden easter eggs in the form of mushrooms that will help you on your journey. These mushrooms will give you the much-needed energy to keep going, just like how your favorite energy drink helps you survive your never-ending classes.

As you progress through the game, you'll encounter obstacles such as unstable Wi-Fi connections, annoying classmates who won't stop messaging you on WhatsApp, and those dreaded online quizzes that never seem to end. But don't worry, we know you can conquer them all!

So put on your gaming hat and get ready to experience the life of a Techno Main Salt Lake student like never before. Remember, the key to success in this game is to be as sarcastic and funny as possible, just like your favorite memes that keep you going through those boring lectures. Let the fun begin!
